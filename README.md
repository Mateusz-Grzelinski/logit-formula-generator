# Logic formula generator

This is random formula generator for various logical systems. Generated are used to measure performance of SAT/SMT solvers. Currently user can generate:
- first order logic: `examples/first_order_logic` in TPTP format
    - in CNF (conjuctive normal form) - completed
    - full FOL (with quantifiers and more logical connectives) - in progress
- propositional temporal logic: `examples/temporal_logic` in format required by solver Inkresat 

This repository is implementation of bachelor thesis "System of random generation of logical formulas for first order logic" by Mateusz Grzeli≈Ñski, but also explores other areas.

## TODO's

- implement full FOL formula generator
- implement incremental benhcmark generation
- streamline fomula generation, benchmarking and analyzing
- add tests

## Run

See `examples/*`
